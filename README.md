# LockedIn Android App

Android app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Project Structure

- `app/src/main/java/com/lockedin/app/` - Main application code
  - `MainActivity.kt` - Entry point with navigation setup
  - `ui/screens/` - Individual screen composables (Screen1-14)
  - `ui/theme/` - Material3 theme configuration

## Screens

The app contains 14 screens corresponding to the reference images in the `Screens/` folder:
- Screen1 (Picture1.png)
- Screen2 (Picture2.png)
- Screen3 (Picture3.png)
- ... and so on through Screen14

## Building

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Run on an emulator or device

## Next Steps

Each screen currently has a placeholder layout. To replicate the UI exactly from the reference images, describe each screen's layout and I'll update the composables accordingly.
